# AI for Haptics and Haptics for AI @ CHI2026

This repository hosts the code for the website of the [AI for Haptics and Haptics for AI: Challenges and Opportunities](https://derikon.github.io/HapticsAI_Workshop/) workshop at the [CHI 2026](https://chi2026.acm.org/) conference.

## Abstract

AI has transformed methods and knowledge across many domains. However, the intersection of AI and haptics remains underexplored. While modern AI techniques such as machine learning, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning offer powerful opportunities for advancing haptic design, insights from haptics research such as perception modeling and adaptive interaction grounded in human touch, embodiment, and multisensory integration can also play a critical role in shaping more human-centered AI systems. This workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers from HCI, haptics, AI, robotics, and design to (1) identify pressing questions in haptics that could benefit from AI approaches and (2) highlight ways in which haptic knowledge can support the development of embodied and context-aware AI. Through position papers and paper presentations, we will map key challenges, exchange methods, and explore new research directions that connect the two fields. By framing haptics and AI as mutually reinforcing, the workshop aims to build a shared research agenda and foster collaborations that advance both the science of touch and the design of intelligent interactive systems.
